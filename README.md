# Simple Chatbot with Memory 
This is a small Python project that provides a chatbot prototype with simple memory capabilities. It's intended as a starting point for building assistant tools that help with video editing workflows and related tasks.

Files
- `abhi.py` — Main script / chatbot entrypoint.
- `list_modules.py` — Helper script to list installed Python modules (utility).

Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer

Quick start
1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Run the chatbot:

```
python abhi.py
```

Development
- Use Git for source control. To push changes to the configured remote run:

```
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README"
git push
```

Notes
- This README is intentionally minimal. Tell me if you want a longer README with examples, env setup, or contribution guidelines.
